      <p>
        Boss is a manufacturer of effects pedals for electric guitar and bass
        guitar. It is a division of the Roland Corporation, a Japanese
        manufacturer that specializes in musical equipment and accessories.
        <br />
        For many years Boss has manufactured a wide range of products related to
        effects processing for guitars, including "compact" and "twin" effects
        pedals, multi-effect pedals, electronic tuners and pedal boards. In more
        recent times, Boss expanded their product range by including digital
        studios, rhythm machines, samplers and other electronic music equipment.
        They also are now manufacturing solid-state amplifiers and speaker heads
        such as the Waza and the Katana. Both feature multi-effects units meant
        to emulate Boss' classic effects pedals.

      <h2 class="manjiNaslov">History</h2>
      <p>
        The earliest Boss product was called B-100 The Boss, released in 1974.
        This came with a clip-on pre-amp and a pickup to amplify acoustic
        guitars. At this point the Boss company had not been formed and it was
        still a Beckmen Musical Instruments product (as seen on the B-100 box).
        The first proper Boss foot pedal effect, the CE-1 Chorus Ensemble, was
        released June 1976, which was a stand-alone unit of the chorus/vibrato
        circuit found in the Roland JC-120 amplifier. It was a fairly large,
        AC-powered unit. Other foot pedals of that year are the GE-10 (a graphic
        equalizer), the BF-1 (a flanger unit) and the DB-5 (a distortion unit).
      </p>
      <p>
        Boss's line of compact pedals began in 1977 with the release of six
        pedals, all of them discontinued: an overdrive pedal (OD-1), a phaser
        pedal (PH-1), a parametric equalizer called the Spectrum (SP-1), a
        6-band graphic equalizer (GE-6), a compressor pedal (CS-1) and an
        automatic wah pedal (TW-1). The Boss DS-1 was released the next year, in
        1978. Their first compact chorus pedal (CE-2) came in 1979, and their
        first flanger pedal (BF-2) in 1980. In 1983 Boss released the DD-2
        Digital Delay, the first mass-produced digital delay in a compact pedal
        format. The Metal Zone (MT-2) was released in 1991. In 1992 Boss
        released nine new pedals, including the Turbo Distortion (DS-2). The
        Heavy Metal (HM-2) distortion pedal was an integral part of the guitar
        sound of many styles of heavy metal music ever since.[6] The pedals all
        share the same 'footprint', for compatibility with pedal boards. Boss
        introduced COSM (Composite Object Sound Modeling), Roland's proprietary
        version of digital modeling technology, into their AC-3 Acoustic
        Simulator pedal in 2006. Boss has since released several pedals using
        COSM, including the FBM-1 '59 Fender Bassman pedal and FDR-1 '65 Fender
        Deluxe Reverb pedal, introduced at the Winter NAMM show in January 2007.
        All Boss compact pedals use a "buffered bypass" type of silent foot
        switching utilizing Field Effect Transistors (FETs) to avoid clicks and
        pops. While not "true" bypass, the buffered bypass has the advantage of
        preventing signal loss due to long runs of cable, while keeping original
        guitar tone intact.
